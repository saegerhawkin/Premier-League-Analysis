# Premier League Analysis #
This is a project I am working on in my own time to analyze soccer data. I am taking a bunch of CSVs, each with a year of premier league data, combining them and writing them to a SQLite Database. Then I am going to some analytics on the data using the database of the combined data. I am planning on looking at my favorite team, West Ham United.

This project is to demonstrate the following skills:
- Python
- SQL
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

### Updates ###
**1/6/2019** <br>
I just finished the excel combining file that writes to a database. I plan to turn this into callable functions where the user can specify the columns they want to keep and whether to write to excel or SQLite. Then it will be able to be used for more than just the soccer data, it could be used to combine any CSVs

**10/27/2019**
- Created python notebook with a start on data analysis
- Did initial exploratory analysis

**12/13/2020**
- Updated code
- Prepped dataset for modelling.

### Future Plans ###
- Optimize excel combining file
  - Turn it into a class
  - Create combining function to be called in python notebook
- Run correlation
- Create models to see what variables attribute to more wins
